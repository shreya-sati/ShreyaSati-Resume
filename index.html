        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Shreya Sati and I am a pre-business major at UC Riverside. I am originally from the Bay Area and I graduated from Amador Valley High School with a 4.0 GPA. My AP coursework consisted of AP French, AP Calculus AB, AP Statistics, AP Government, AP Macroeconomics, AP Language and Composition, AP World History, and AP Psychology. My honors courses included Honors Geometry and Honors Freshman English. <br><br>

        Outside of school, I have a lot of interesting hobbies. I have been playing the piano since I was 8 years old and am in the process of being CM certified. I have played at many recitals before and can play anything from classical to pop music. I also played volleyball for four years and was the captain for two out of four years. I played club sport as well as for my high school team. I am a big lover of sports and have also played recreational basketball and was a swimmer. I also love to paint and read books. Currently, I am in the process of reading Life of Pi which has so far been a great read. <br><br>

        I plan to be in Finance because I have always have had a love for business and money. I have had an entrepreneurial spirit since I was young. I found out pretty early that everything holds a little bit of value and those with a lot of money are people that are able to find that value and profit of of it. In fact, one of my favorite childhood stories was an Indian tale called the "Mouse Merchant" in which a man bartered a mouse and then continued bartering until he became rich. Inspired by this, I also used to barter on the playground as a young five year old. I would sell a mini bouquet of daises for a new toy. Eventually, I advanced from this. In middle and high school, I would sell snacks for a marked up price. I would supply the products that people demanded the most and this taught me all about markets. I ran a Depop account in which I have been able to make and sell homemade jewelry as well as old shirts. I made quite a lot of profit by pinpointing what people wanted in the market and then selling it. I have been able to find $4 shirts and sell them for a profit of $24 by marketing them properly and not accepting lowball offers. Finance is a personal interest of mine. I remember being the only one in my freshman year class watching stock markets and talking to my parents about investing money in my name. I have yet to find internships and jobs for it, but I have internship experience with a mental health company in which I can use some transferrable skills to help me. Be sure to email me if you are looking for a committed intern or employee that loves everything about the business world and finance.
